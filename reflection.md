- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
House Class:
For house class I decdied to overload my constructor twice.
First I created a constructor that made a small house with onyl a single story, so hardcoded number of floors, no elevator and no dining room
Second I created a constructor that now had a dining room, so a bit larger but was still a single story house with no elevator and a set number of floors at 1.
For cafe class I overloaded my constructor twice, and then my sell coffee method
First I made a cafe that could only be a Dunkin, hard coding the name
Then I made a cafe which only sold 16oz coffees, hardcoding nCoffeeOunces. 
I overloaded the sellcoffee method, first making it so every coffee came with three sugars and creams
Then I overloaded the method to allow for vairance in number of creams and sugars
For the library class I overloaded the constructor twice, and the checkOut method.
First I created a library that was only Neilson, hardocding the name, address, nFloors, and elevator of the constructor to make the library only create neilson
Then I overloaded it to allow for variance in name, address, and floors, but hardcoded elevator boolean to false, thinking this version of the constructor could be used for libraries old enough that they did not have elevators.
I made the checkOut method, make every patron of the library check out the same book, War and Peace. 
I then overloaded the checkOut method so that the title entered as a parameter would be the book the patron checked out and removed that book from the collection.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
What worked was starting really early, that way I had time to figure out what I was confused about and then still had time to ask my question in office hours. What was difficult was decifering what exactly this assignment was asking me to do, I found the instructions a little confusing at times. My advice would be to start early and go to office hours!
